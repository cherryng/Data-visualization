For a given telescope location (example being CHIME/CHORD), shows the pulsars visible on sky at a given time.

Count the number of pulsars observable as a function of declination/altitude (represented by colours). 


The number of observable pulsars is also dependant on the field-of-view (FOV) of the telescope. 

Two scenarios are shown below, one with a 2 deg FOV and one with 10 deg.
